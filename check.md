### ✅ **Explanation for Coding AI Agent (Material, Stock, GST Flow)**

**Point 3 – Material Ordering (Engineer → Manager approval)**
Engineers must be able to create **material requests** by selecting project, material, quantity, and remarks.
Each request starts with status **PENDING**.
Managers can **approve or reject** requests.
**Only approved requests** are allowed to move forward for procurement or stock entry.
No material should enter stock without an approved request.

---

**Point 5 – Stock Tracking (Material IN / OUT)**
Stock is tracked **per project and per material**.
When material physically arrives on site, a **Stock IN transaction** is recorded and linked to an **approved material request**, increasing available stock.
When material is used for work, a **Stock OUT transaction** is recorded, decreasing stock.
Every stock change must create a transaction record (IN or OUT).
The system must **prevent negative stock** and allow real-time visibility to detect wastage or theft.

**Point 6 – Automatic GST Bills**
GST invoices must be **auto-generated by the system**, not manually created.
Invoices are generated **only from approved and completed work** (approved DPRs / completed tasks).
Each invoice should include:

* Line items (work/material)
* Taxable amount
* GST percentage per item
* Total GST amount
* Grand total
  Invoices are **read-only for Owners** and used for reporting and accounting.
